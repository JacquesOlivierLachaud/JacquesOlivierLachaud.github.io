abstract: 'Computing differential quantities or solving partial derivative
equations on discrete surfaces is at the core of many geometry
processing and simulation tasks. For digital surfaces in
{{< math >}}$\mathbb{Z}^3${{< /math >}} (boundary of voxels), several challenges arise when
trying to define a discrete calculus framework on such surfaces
mimicking the continuous one: the vertex positions and the geometry of
faces do not capture well the geometry of the underlying smooth
Euclidean object, even when refined asymptotically. Furthermore, the
surface may not be a combinatorial 2-manifold even for discretizations
of smooth regular shape. In this paper, we adapt a discrete
differential calculus defined on polygonal meshes to the specific case
of digital surfaces. We show that this discrete differential calculus
accurately mimics the continuous calculus operating on the underlying
smooth object, through several experiments: convergence of gradient
and weak Laplace operators, spectral analysis and geodesic
computations, mean curvature approximation and tolerance to
non-manifold locii.'
