abstract: 'Geometric priors have been shown to be useful in image
segmentation to regularize results. For example, the classical
Mumford-Shah functional uses region perimeter as prior. This has
inspired much research in the last few decades, with classical
approaches like the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi and most graph-cut
formulations, which all use a weighted or binary perimeter prior.  It
has been observed that this prior is not suitable in many
applications, for example for segmenting thin objects or some
textures, which may have high perimeter/surface ratio. Mumford
observed that an interesting prior for natural objects is the Euler
Elastical model, which involves the squared curvature. In other areas
of science, researchers have noticed that some physical binarization
processes, like emulsion unmixing can be well-approximated by
curvature-related flow like the Willmore flow. However,
curvature-related flows are not easy to compute because curvature is
difficult to estimate accurately, and the underlying optimisation
processes are not convex. In this article, we propose to formulate a
digital flow that approximates an Elastica-related flow using a
multigrid-convergent curvature estimator, within a discrete
variational framework. We also present an application of this model as
a post-processing step to a segmentation framework.'
