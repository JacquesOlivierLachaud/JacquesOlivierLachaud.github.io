Recent works propose optimization methods for solving these two joint problems at the same time with variational models, but they tend to be slower than other cutting methods. We present a new variational approach for this problem inspired by the Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional, which is easier to optimize than already existing methods. This functional has widely been used in image and geometry processing for anisotropic denoising and segmentation applications. The key feature of this functional is to model both regions where smoothing is applied, and the loci of discontinuities corresponding to the cuts. Our approach relies on this principle to model both the low distortion objective of the UV map, and the minimization of the seams length (sequences of mesh edges). Our method significantly reduces the distortion in a faster way than state-of-the art methods, with comparable seam quality. We also demonstrate the versatility of the approach when external constraints on the parameterization is provided (packing constraints, seam visibility).","tags":["mesh parameterization","UV mapping","variational model","Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional","joint distortion and cut","discrete calculus"],"title":"Joint optimization of distortion and cut location for mesh parameterization using an Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Coeurjolly","Bertrand Kerautret","Jacques-Olivier Lachaud","Tristan Roussillon"],"categories":null,"content":"Tutorial prepared by D.

The targeted geometrical models (polygonal meshes, point clouds, surfaces of voxel sets) are usually defective for direct geometry processing: deficient or missing topology, self-intersections, holes, non-manifold parts, perturbations, outliers. Their common characteristic is to be approximations of an underlying smooth object and not an interpolation of its boundary. Our approach is to build stable geometric proxies (embedded in a regular lattice) for these various data, for two main goals: first to guarantee that the estimates or the results of the calculus are theoretically accurate or stable (when compared to their counterpart from the continuous analysis), second to design practical algorithms that scale well in terms of performance, numerical stability, capability to represent various dimensional objects (volumes, surfaces, 1d curves in space), and memory efficiency (thanks to a multiscale approach). This unified approach provides generic tools to measure quantities and perform calculus on such discrete data, and allows modeling and simulation of complex and natural phenomena on various real geometric data. We will more specifically explore applications in material engineering (analysis and calculus on high resolution volumetric surfaces from micro-tomographic images, fracture simulation on materials…), the geometry processing of acquired massive, highly detailed, 3D point clouds (e.g, billions of points acquired with LiDAR or photogrammetry).\n","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"e84346b45f5409127912c6b125dd680d","permalink":"https://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/pagesmembres/lachaud/public/project/stable-proxies/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pagesmembres/lachaud/public/project/stable-proxies/","section":"project","summary":"*Stable Geometry Processing and High Performance Calculus on Heterogeneous Geometrical Data*\n\n(ANR project ANR-22-CE46)\n\nFeb. 2023 - Jan. 2028\n\n**Team Leader** LAMA","tags":["digital geometry","computational geometry","cloud of points","discrete calculus","3D","shape optimization","geometry processing","geometric measure theory"],"title":"StableProxies","type":"project"},{"authors":["David Coeurjolly","Jacques-Olivier Lachaud"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667493594,"objectID":"19fa5450c64511d78d8e408534204421","permalink":"https://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/pagesmembres/lachaud/public/publication/coeurjolly-2022-dgmm/","publishdate":"2022-11-03T16:39:54.380753Z","relpermalink":"/pagesmembres/lachaud/public/publication/coeurjolly-2022-dgmm/","section":"publication","summary":"Computing differential quantities or solving partial derivative equations on discrete surfaces is at the core of many geometry processing and simulation tasks.

Furthermore, the surface may not be a combinatorial 2-manifold even for discretizations of smooth regular shape. In this paper, we adapt a discrete differential calculus defined on polygonal meshes to the specific case of digital surfaces. We show that this discrete differential calculus accurately mimics the continuous calculus operating on the underlying smooth object, through several experiments: convergence of gradient and weak Laplace operators, spectral analysis and geodesic computations, mean curvature approximation and tolerance to non-manifold locii.","tags":["discrete calculus","digital surface","3D","discrete differential operator","multigrid convergence"],"title":"A Simple Discrete Calculus for Digital Surfaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacques-Olivier Lachaud"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667493585,"objectID":"136cd5eacad3440612699a86f29d0ca7","permalink":"https://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/pagesmembres/lachaud/public/publication/lachaud-2022-jmiv/","publishdate":"2022-11-03T16:39:45.518558Z","relpermalink":"/pagesmembres/lachaud/public/publication/lachaud-2022-jmiv/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes full convexity as an alternative definition of digital convexity, which is valid in arbitrary dimension.

As a byproduct, our tool is able to correctly estimate curvatures over polyhedral approximations of shapes with explicit bounds, even when their natural normal are not correct, as long as an external convergent normal vector field is provided.

This defect might forbid digital polyhedral models with fully convex faces and edges. This can be detrimental since classical standard and naive planes are fully convex. We propose in this paper an envelope operator which solves in arbitrary dimension the problem of extending a digital set into a fully convex set. This extension naturally leads to digital polyhedra whose cells are fully convex. We present first a generic envelope operator which add points in required directions in parallel and prove that it builds a fully convex set. Then a relative envelope operator is proposed, which can be used to force digital planarity of fully convex sets.

For example, the classical Mumford-Shah functional uses region perimeter as prior. This has inspired much research in the last few decades, with classical approaches like the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi and most graph-cut formulations, which all use a weighted or binary perimeter prior.  It has been observed that this prior is not suitable in many applications, for example for segmenting thin objects or some textures, which may have high perimeter/surface ratio. Mumford observed that an interesting prior for natural objects is the Euler Elastical model, which involves the squared curvature. In other areas of science, researchers have noticed that some physical binarization processes, like emulsion unmixing can be well-approximated by curvature-related flow like the Willmore flow. However, curvature-related flows are not easy to compute because curvature is difficult to estimate accurately, and the underlying optimisation processes are not convex. In this article, we propose to formulate a digital flow that approximates an Elastica-related flow using a multigrid-convergent curvature estimator, within a discrete variational framework. We also present an application of this model as a post-processing step to a segmentation framework.","tags":["image segmentation","image analysis","variational model","geometric prior","elastica model","shape optimization"],"title":"An Elastica-Driven Digital Curve Evolution Model for Image Segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Coeurjolly","Jacques-Olivier Lachaud","Pierre Gueth"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667493586,"objectID":"617fa2f8c65cbf14296f41007c28371a","permalink":"https://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/pagesmembres/lachaud/public/publication/coeurjolly-2021-tvcg/","publishdate":"2022-11-03T16:39:45.955468Z","relpermalink":"/pagesmembres/lachaud/public/publication/coeurjolly-2021-tvcg/","section":"publication","summary":"Digital objects and digital surfaces are isothetic structures per se.

This predicate is used to probe the digital plane as locally as possible and decide on-the-fly the next points to consider. However, several existing plane-probing algorithms return the correct normal vector only for some specific starting points and an approximation otherwise, e.g. the H- and R-algorithm proposed in Lachaud et al. (J. Math. Imaging Vis., 59, 1, 23--39, 2017). In this paper, we present a general framework for these plane-probing algorithms that provides a way of retrieving the correct normal vector from any starting point, while keeping their main features. There are {{\u003c math \u003e}}$O(\\omega \\log \\omega)${{\u003c /math \u003e}} calls to the predicate in the worst-case scenario, where {{\u003c math \u003e}}$\\omega${{\u003c /math \u003e}} is the thickness of the underlying digital plane, but far fewer calls are experimentally observed on average. In the context of digital surface analysis, the resulting algorithm is expected to be of great interest for normal estimation and shape reconstruction.","tags":["digital geometry","discrete geometric estimator","3D","plane probing","digital planarity"],"title":"An Optimized Framework for Plane-Probing Algorithms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacques-Olivier Lachaud","Pascal Romon","Boris Thibert","David Coeurjolly"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667493586,"objectID":"83871b6a49862c49171d71ef0cea41f6","permalink":"https://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/pagesmembres/lachaud/public/publication/lachaud-2020-cgf/","publishdate":"2022-11-03T16:39:46.16722Z","relpermalink":"/pagesmembres/lachaud/public/publication/lachaud-2020-cgf/","section":"publication","summary":" A consistent and yet practically accurate definition of curvature onto polyhedral meshes remains an open problem. We propose a new framework to define curvature measures, based on the *Corrected Normal Current*, which generalizes the normal cycle: it uncouples the positional information of the polyhedral mesh from its geometric normal vector field, and the user can freely choose the *corrected* normal vector field at vertices for curvature computations. A smooth surface is then built in the Grassmannian {{\u003c math \u003e}}$\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{S}^2${{\u003c /math \u003e}} by simply interpolating the given normal vector field. Curvature measures are then computed using the usual Lipschitz--Killing forms, and we provide closed-form formulas per triangle. We prove a stability result with respect to perturbations of positions and normals. Our approach provides a natural scale-space for all curvature estimations, where the scale is given by the radius of the measuring ball. We show on experiments how this method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on clean and noisy data, and even achieves pointwise convergence on difficult polyhedral meshes like digital surfaces. The framework is also well suited to curvature computations using normal map information.","tags":["normal current","curvature measures","curvature estimator","discrete geometric estimator","3D","polygonal mesh"],"title":"Interpolated corrected curvature measures for polygonal surfaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bertrand Kerautret","Jacques-Olivier Lachaud"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1574693100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574693100,"objectID":"50d4550ba17251514d3693000cd48c25","permalink":"https://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/pagesmembres/lachaud/public/talk/digital-geometry-in-pattern-recognition-extracting-geometric-features-with-dgtal-and-applications/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pagesmembres/lachaud/public/talk/digital-geometry-in-pattern-recognition-extracting-geometric-features-with-dgtal-and-applications/","section":"event","summary":"A tutorial on digital geometry and its applications to pattern recognition","tags":["talk","dgtal","digital geometry","pattern recognition","image analysis","digital straightness","digital surface","discrete geometric estimator"],"title":"Digital Geometry in Pattern Recognition: Extracting Geometric Features with DGtal and Applications","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

While voxel grids can represent complete objects – including parts not visible in the sketches – their memory consumption restricts them to low-resolution predictions. In contrast, a single normal or depth map can capture fine details, but multiple maps from different viewpoints need to be predicted and fused to produce a closed surface. We propose to combine these two representations to address their respective shortcom- ings in the context of a multi-view sketch-based modeling system. Our method predicts a voxel grid common to all the input sketches, along with one normal map per sketch. We then use the voxel grid as a support for normal map fusion by optimizing its extracted surface such that it is consistent with the re-projected normals, while being as piecewise-smooth as possible overall. We compare our method with a recent voxel prediction system, demonstrating improved recovery of sharp features over a variety of man-made objects.","tags":["deep learning","multi-view reconstruction","discrete geometric estimator","3D","digital geometry application"],"title":"Combining voxel and normal predictions for multi-view 3D sketching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

These are ubiquitous in biomedical imaging (e.g. vascular networks), in which length regularization can sometime perform badly, as well as in texture identification. However, curvature is a second-order differential measure, and so its estimators are sensitive to noise. The straightforward extensions to Total Variation are not convex, making them a challenge to optimize.  State-of-art techniques make use of a coarse approximation of curvature that limits practical applications.\nWe argue that curvature must instead be computed using a multigrid convergent estimator, and we propose in this paper a new digital curvature flow which mimics continuous curvature flow. We illustrate its potential as a post-processing step to a variational segmentation framework.

We propose a more efficient storage strategy with a dedicated multi-image representation that retains only significant phase field values at each discretization point. We show that this strategy alone is unfortunately inefficient with classical phase field models. This is due to non local terms and low convergence rate.  We therefore introduce and analyze an improved phase field model that localizes each phase field around its associated region, and which fully benefits of our storage strategy.\nTo demonstrate the efficiency of the new multiphase field framework, we apply it to the famous 3D honeycomb problem and the conjecture of Weaire-Phelan’s tiling.

Although seductive, this minimization is in practice difficult because it requires to jointly define a sharp set of contours and a smooth version of the initial image. For this reason, various relaxations of the original formulations have been proposed, together with optimisation methods. Among these, the Ambrosio-Tortorelli (AT) parametric functional is of particular interest, because minimizers of AT can be shown to converge to a minimizer of MS. However this convergence is difficult to achieve numerically using standard finite difference schemes. Indeed, with AT, discontinuities need to be represented explicitly rather than implicitly. In this work, we propose to formulate AT using the full framework of Discrete Calculus (DC), which is able to sharply represent discontinuities thanks to a more sophisticated topological framework. We present our proposed formulation, its resolution, and results on synthetic and real images. We show that we are indeed able to represent sharp discontinuities and as a result significantly better stability to noise, compared with finite difference schemes.","tags":["discrete calculus","ambrosio-tortorelli functional","image analysis","image restoration","image inpainting","piecewise smooth reconstruction"],"title":"Image restoration and segmentation using the Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional and discrete calculus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

When the digital surface is a digitization of a piecewise smooth manifold, our method localizes sharp features (edges) while regularizing the input normal vector field at the same time. It relies on the optimisation of a variant of the Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional, originally defined for denoising and contour extraction in image processing [AT90]. We reformulate this functional to digital surface processing thanks to discrete calculus operators. Experiments show that the output normal field is very robust to digitization artifacts or noise, and also fairly independent of the sampling resolution. The method allows the user to choose independently the amount of smoothing and the length of the set of discontinuities.  Sharp and vanishing features are correctly delineated even on extremely damaged data. Finally, our method can be used to enhance considerably the output of state-of-the-art normal field estimators like Voronoi Covariance Measure [MOG11] or Randomized Hough Transform [BM12].

The digitized boundary is shown to be close to the Euclidean boundary in the Hausdorff sense, the minimum distance h√d/2 being achieved by the projection map ξ induced by the Euclidean distance. Although it is known that Gauss digitized boundaries may not be manifold when d \u003e= 3, we show that non-manifoldness may only occur in places where the normal vector is almost aligned with some digitization axis, and the limit angle decreases with h. We then have a closer look at the projection of the digitized boundary onto the continuous boundary by ξ. We show that the size of its non-injective part tends to zero with h. This leads us to study the classical digital surface integration scheme, which allocates a measure to each surface element that is proportional to the cosine of the angle between an estimated normal vector and the trivial surface element normal vector. We show that digital integration is convergent whenever the normal estimator is multigrid convergent, and we explicit the convergence speed. Since convergent estimators are now available in the literature, digital integration provides a convergent measure for digitized objects.

Such estimators should induce convergent metrics for many different subsets of digital spaces.

We propose a new robust method to detect features on digital data (surface of objects in Z3), which exploits asymptotic properties of recent digital curvature estimators. In [1, 2], authors have proposed curvature estimators (mean, principal and Gaussian) on 2D and 3D digitized shapes and have demonstrated their multigrid convergence (for C 3-smooth surfaces). Since such approaches integrate local information within a ball around points of interest, the radius is a crucial parameter. In this article, we consider the radius as a scale-space parameter. By analyzing the behavior of such curvature estimators as the ball radius tends to zero, we propose a tool to efficiently characterize and extract several relevant features (edges, smooth and flat parts) on digital surfaces.

The method consists in two stages. In the first stage, a multi-scale analysis of the contour is conducted so as to identify noisy or damaged parts of the contour as well as the intensity of the perturbation. All the identified scales are then merged so that the input data is covered by a set of pixels whose size is increased according to the local intensity of noise. The second stage consists in transforming this set of resized pixels into an irregular isothetic object composed of an ordered set of rectangular and axisaligned cells. Its topology is stored as a Reeb graph, which allows an easy pruning of its unnecessary spurious edges. Every remaining connected part has the topology of a circle and a polygonal representation is independently computed for each of them. Four different geometrical algorithms, including a new one, are reviewed for the latter task. These vectorization algorithms are experimentally evaluated and the whole method is also compared to previous works on both synthetic and true digital images. For fair comparisons, when possible, several error measures between the reconstruction and the ground truth are given for the different techniques.

We propose an original strategy to detect the relevant scales at which each point of the digital contours should be considered. It relies on theoretical results of asymptotic discrete geometry. A direct consequence is the automatic detection of the noisy or damaged parts of the contour, together with its quantitative evaluation (or noise level). Apart from a given maximal observation scale, the proposed approach does not require any parameter tuning and is easy to implement. We demonstrate its effectiveness on several datasets. We present different direct applications of this local measure to contour smoothing and geometric estimators whose algorithms initially required a noise/scale parameter to tune: They show the pertinence of the proposed measure for digital shape analysis and reconstruction.

Its accuracy is dependent on the correct evaluation of the amount of noise, which was set by the user in this former version. In the present work we integrate a promising unsupervised noise detection method [2] in this arc recognition method, in order to process images with or without noise, uniformly distributed or variable within the picture. We evaluate the performance of this algorithm and we compare it with standard arc and circle detection methods based on extensions of the Hough transform.

Maximal segments appear to hold many interesting properties for analyzing digital shapes. We will show here that they provide good length and tangent estimators and also characterize the convex and concave parts of the shape. They induce discrete geometric estimators that are multigrid convergent, with a quantifiable error. These asymptotic properties of maximal segments are also extremely useful to detect the local meaningful scales at which the shape should be analyzed: in this sense, they provide an unsupervised method to determine locally the level of noise that is damaging the shape.

In this paper, we propose a comparative evaluation of these estimators, testing their accuracy, efficiency, and robustness with respect to several type of degradations.

L'existence d'un trou dans un objet (au sens où un anneau a un trou et un pantalon a deux trous) n'est pas modifiée par une déformation ``continue'' de l'objet.  D'un point de vue algorithmique, on cherche souvent à concevoir des méthodes de traitement d'image qui ne modifient pas la topologie des objets (connexité, existence d'un trou, etc).  Le formalisme mathématique nécessaire pour définir de telles méthodes est assez abstrait.\nAu sens de la topologie, on peut dire que toutes les courbes fermées simples sont équivalentes (ou homéomorphes), et toute courbe fermée simple dans le plan possède un trou, au sens où elle sépare le plan (théorème de Jordan). La notion de déformation continue est formalisée dans la notion d'homotopie. Cette notion permet d'associer aux objets discrets des objets algébriques (des groupes), de manière qu'à deux objets topologiquement équivalents soient associés deux groupes équivalents. Ces invariants algébriques sont fondamentaux dans l'étude des propriétés topologiques des objets. Cette même notion d'homotopie permet de définir les points simples, qui sont les points qu'on peut enlever d'un objet sans en modifier la topologie. Les points simples sont en particulier à la base des algorithmes de squelettisation topologique.\nD'autres notions fondamentales en topologie sont les frontières et les surfaces. Par exemple, la frontière d'un objet connexe sans cavité est connexe. Une telle frontière doit satisfaire la propriété de séparation de Jordan. En topologie digitale, on se donne les outils pour définir des frontières et surfaces discrètes qui ont une bonne propriété de séparation. Ces frontières sont ensuite munies de structures de graphes, qui permettent de les construire et de les parcourir efficacement. Des outils existent ensuite pour estimer la géométrie de ces objets ou pour en fabriquer des modèles géométriques.

Cette transformation ne sera pas forcément réversible. La relaxation de cette contrainte offre en effet plus de flexibilité. Nous aborderons plusieurs problématiques : Volumique vers surfacique. Les surfaces discrètes ne sont pas toujours exploitables directement, et la transformation de l'image 3D directement en une représentation surfacique (un maillage) est parfois souhaitable, notamment pour le rendu ou l'extraction quantitative de caractéristiques. Nous verrons une technique d'extraction de surfaces d'intérêt directement à partir d'une image 3D, binaire ou non. Surface discrète vers surface triangulée. Il est parfois commode de passer d'une représentation par surface discrète à une représentation par surface triangulée. Nous présenterons deux techniques complémentaires : la dualité surface discrète et isosurface pour construire une surface triangulée approchant la surface discrète (approximation réversible), une technique non réversible d'approximation de surface discrète sous forme d'une surface triangulée, qui est basée sur de la triangulation de points caractérisques par amincissement homotopique. Simplification et remaillage de surfaces. Un maillage possède parfois trop d'éléments pour être affiché ou traité sur une machine possédant des ressources limitées (mémoire, vitesse). La simplification du maillage résout ce problème en réduisant son nombre d'éléments tout en conservant au mieux les caractérisques géométriques initiales. Plusieurs critères peuvent être pris en compte lors de la simplification : type des éléments crées (triangles, quadrangles, polygones), qualité de l'approximation (distance de Hausdorff), qualité des éléments générés (rapport d'aspect, régularité de la triangulation). D'autre part, l'efficacité de certaines applications est parfois dépendante de la qualité du maillage (régularité de l'échantillonnage, facteur de forme des éléments). En particulier, la précision des applications de simulation par éléments finis est directement dépendante du facteur de forme des éléments du maillage. Dans ce cas, remailler un modèle permet de rester fidèle à la forme initiale de l'objet, tout en améliorant les résultats d'une éventuelle simulation numérique.

However there is a trade-off between model genericity, model accuracy and computational efficiency. In general, fully generic models require a uniform sampling of either the space or their mesh. The segmentation accuracy is thus a global parameter. Recovering small image features results in heavy computational costs whereas generally only restricted parts of images require a high segmentation accuracy.\nThis paper presents a highly deformable model that both handles fully automated topology changes and adapts its resolution locally according to the geometry of image features. The main idea is to replace the Euclidean metric with a Riemannian metric that expands interesting parts of the image. Then, a regular sampling is maintained with this new metric. This allows to automatically handle topology changes while increasing the model resolution locally according to the geometry of image components. By this way high quality segmentation is achieved with reduced computational costs.

Highly deformable models extend them with the ability to handle dynamic topological changes, and therefore to extract arbitrary complex shapes. However, the resolution of these models largely depends on the resolution of the image. As a consequence, their time and memory complexity increases at least as fast as the size of input data. In this paper we extend an existing highly deformable model, so that it is able to locally adapt its resolution with respect to its position. With this property, a significant precision is achieved in the interesting parts of the image, while a coarse resolution is maintained elsewhere. The general idea is to replace the Euclidean metric of the image space by a deformed non-Euclidean metric, which geometrically expands areas of interest. With this approach, we obtain a new model that follows the robust framework of classical deformable models, while offering a significant independence from both the size of input data and the geometric complexity of image components.

Further processing (such as quantitative analysis, morphometric measurements, shape description) requires volume representations. The skeleton representation matches these requirements by providing a concise description of the object. This paper has two parts. First, we exhibit an algorithm which locally builds an iso-surface with two significant properties: it is a 2-manifold and the surface is a subcomplex of the Delaunay tetrahedrization of its vertices. Secondly, because of the latter property, the skeleton can in turn be computed from the dual of the Delaunay tetrahedrization of the iso-surface vertices. The skeleton representation, although informative, is very sensitive to noise. This is why we associate a graph to each skeleton for two purposes: (i) the amount of noise can be identified and quantified on the graph and (ii) the selection of the graph subpart that does not correspond to noise induces a filtering on the skeleton. Finally, we show some results on synthetic and medical images. An application, measuring the thickness of objects (heart ventricles, bone samples) is also presented.

Classically, two approaches are followed. The first considers the image as a sample of a continuous scalar field: boundaries are implicit surfaces in this field; they are often called iso-surfaces. The second considers the image as a digital space with adjacency relations and classifies elements of this space as inside or outside: boundaries are pairs composed of one inside element and one outside element; they are called digital boundaries. In this paper, we show that these two approaches are closely related. This statement holds for arbitrary dimensions. To do so, we propose a local method to construct a continuous analog of a digital boundary. The continuous analog is designed to satisfy properties in the Euclidean space that are similar to the properties of its counterpart in the digital space (e.g., connectedness, closeness, separation). It appears that this continuous analog is indeed a piecewise linear approximation of an iso-(hyper)surface (i.e., a triangulated iso-surface in the three-dimensional case). Furthermore, we derive significant digital boundary properties from its continuous analog using the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem: new Jordan pairs, new adjacencies between boundary elements, new Jordan triples. We conclude this paper by illustrating the 3D case more precisely. In particular, we show that a digital boundary can be transformed directly into a triangulated iso-surface. The implementation of this transformation and its efficiency are discussed with a comparison with the classical marching-cubes algorithm.

In order to speed up the process, an algorithm of pyramid construction with any reduction factor transforms the image into a set of images with progressive resolutions. This organization into a hierarchy, combined with a model which can adapt its sampling to the resolution of the workspace, enables a fast estimation of the shapes included in the image.
