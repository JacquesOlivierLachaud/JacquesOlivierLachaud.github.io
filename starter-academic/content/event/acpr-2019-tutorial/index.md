title: 'Digital Geometry in Pattern Recognition: Extracting Geometric Features with DGtal and Applications'

event: 5th Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition (ACPR 2019)
event_url: https://www.acpr2019.org/

location: Auckland, New Zealand

summary: 'A tutorial on digital geometry and its applications to pattern recognition'
abstract: '
Estimating geometric parameters can play an important role in
different applications of pattern recognition algorithms. The purpose
of this tutorial is to present new efficient and easy to reproduce
algorithms dedicated to the robust extraction of geometric features on
digital objects. The tutorial will consist of a rapid overview of the
theoretical description of recent estimators (like tangent, curvature
or noise estimators) followed by the implementation details given
through the DGtal library. To introduce this library, a quick look of
the main features will be presented with preliminary exercises
available online before the tutorial.

To simplify interaction and demonstration like in teaching activities,
the use of the [DGtal](https://dgtal.org) library will be embedded in a *Jupyter*
notebook allowing online demonstration from a single web browser. In
the continuity and complement of this online notebook, we will propose
to the audience to construct its own online demonstration by using the
new automatic demonstration kernel recently proposed in the [Image Processing On Line journal](ipol.im).
