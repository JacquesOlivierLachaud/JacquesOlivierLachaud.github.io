summary:  Invited talk at Meeting on Tomography and Applications 2025
abstract: 'This talk presents several aspects of convexity in digital spaces
Z^d. We first examine the geometry of the digitization of convex
shapes and, more precisely determine how the convex hull of these
lattice points is close to the geometry of the convex shape before
digitization. Under some smoothness properties, we establish that the
convex hull is Hausdorff close to the original shape proportionnaly to
the digitization gridstep h. Convex hull vertices are shown to be much
closer to the shape than expected (proportional to h^(2d/(d+1))). This
explains why the convex hull is an appealing reconstruction of digital
convex objects. We then show that the normal vector to the convex hull
facets converges to the normal vectors of the smooth convex shape with
a speed proportional to sqrt(h), and the bound is tight. Secondly we
study how we can define the notion of local convexity without recourse
to differential geometry. The problem is decomposed into two stages:
(i) identification of locally extremal points using a plane-probing
variant, (ii) joining pairs of extremal points whenever the straight
segment between them stays sufficiently close to the input surface
without crossing it (visibility). Finally, convex and concave
polyhedral approximations are computed from the previously obtained
soup of candidate edges. The method output is exactly the convex hull
of the input surface if it is digitally convex and is composed of
polyhedral approximations of the convex and concave parts otherwise.'
