title: 'Digital convexity and digital planarity, global and local perspectives'

event: 'Meeting on Tomography and Applications (May 6, 2019 â€“ May 8, 2019)'
event_url: 'https://www.mate.polimi.it/events/TAIR2019/'

location: Politecnico di Milano

summary:  Invited talk at Meeting on Tomography and Applications 2019
abstract: 'This talk will present old and new results on digital convexity in 2D
and 3D, with an emphasis with the link with digital linearity and
planarity. In 2D, we will relate convexity to local contour analysis,
either by digital straight segments or by word decomposition. In 3D, it
is much more challenging to use digital plane recognition algorithm to
analyse the object geometry. We will present a new class of algorithms
that probe locally planes to determine its geometry. Their use for
locally analysing the convexity of arbitrary 3D shapes will be demonstrated.'
