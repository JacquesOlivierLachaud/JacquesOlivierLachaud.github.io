abstract: 'This talk presents several methods to estimate geometric
quantities on subsets of the digital space Zd. We take an interest both on
global geometric quantities like volume and area, and on local geometric
quantities like normal and curvatures. All presented methods have the
common property to be multigrid convergent, i.e. the estimated quantities
tend to their Euclidean counterpart on  ner and  ner digitizations
of (smooth enough) Euclidean shapes. Furthermore, all methods rely
on digital integrals, which approach either volume integrals or surface
integrals along shape boundary. With such tools, we achieve multigrid
convergent estimators of volume, moments and area in Zd, of normals,
curvature and curvature tensor in Z2 and Z3, and of covariance measure
and normals in Zd even with Hausdorff noise.'
