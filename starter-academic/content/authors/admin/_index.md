I am Professor of Computer Science at [University Savoie Mont
Blanc](https://www.univ-smb.fr), and member of the [Laboratory of
Mathematics](https://www.lama.univ-smb.fr). I am responsible of the
[Cursus Master en Ingénierie
Informatique](https://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/CMI_Info/), and I teach
in the Computer Science department of [UFR Science and
Montagne](https://www.univ-smb.fr/scem/). My research interests
includes digital geometry and topology, image segmentation and
analysis, geometry processing, variational models, and discrete
calculus. Albeit not an expert, I am also quite fond of arithmetic,
word combinatorics, computational geometry, combinatorial topology,
differential geometry and I often use several related results in my
research.
