abstract: '
Many combinatorial structures have been designed to represent the topology of space subdivisions and images. We focus here on two particular models, namely the n-G-maps used in geometric modeling and computational geometry and the n-surfaces used in discrete imagery. We show that a subclass of n-G-maps is equivalent to n-surfaces. To achieve this, we provide several characterizations of n-surfaces. Finally, the proofs being constructive, we show how to switch from one representation to another effectively.
