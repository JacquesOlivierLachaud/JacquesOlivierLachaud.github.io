abstract: 'In a recent work, full convexity has been proposed as an
alternative definition of digital convexity. It solves many problems
related to its usual definitions, for instance: fully convex sets are
digitally convex in the usual sense, but are also connected and simply
connected. However, full convexity is not a monotone property hence
intersections of fully convex sets may be neither fully convex nor
connected. This defect might forbid digital polyhedral models with
fully convex faces and edges. This can be detrimental since classical
standard and naive planes are fully convex. We propose in this paper
an envelope operator which solves in arbitrary dimension the problem
of extending a digital set into a fully convex set. This extension
naturally leads to digital polyhedra whose cells are fully convex. We
present first a generic envelope operator which add points in required
directions in parallel and prove that it builds a fully convex
set. Then a relative envelope operator is proposed, which can be used
to force digital planarity of fully convex sets. We provide
experiments showing that our method produces coherent polyhedral
models for any polyhedron in arbitrary dimension.'
