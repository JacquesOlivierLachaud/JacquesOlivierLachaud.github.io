abstract: '
This paper presents a new tangent estimator to digitized curves based
on digital line recognition. It outperforms existing ones on important
criteria while keeping the same computation time: accuracy on smooth
or polygonal shapes, isotropy, preservation of inflexion points and
convexity, asymptotic behaviour. Its asymptotic convergence (sometimes
called <i> multigrid convergence</i>) is proved in the case of convex
shapes.
