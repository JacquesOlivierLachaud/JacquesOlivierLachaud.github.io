abstract: 'This paper proposes full convexity as an alternative definition
of digital convexity, which is valid in arbitrary dimension. It solves
many problems related to its usual de nitions, like possible non connectedness
or non simple connectedness, while encompassing its desirable
features. Fully convex sets are digitally convex, but are connected and
simply connected. They have a morphological characterisation, which
induces a simple convexity test algorithm. Arithmetic planes are fully
convex too. We obtain a natural de nition of tangent subsets to a digital
surface, which gives rise to the tangential cover in 2D, and to its extensions
in arbitrary dimension. Finally it leads to a simple algorithm for
building a polygonal mesh from a set of digital points.'
