abstract: '
Deformable models are continuous energy-minimizing techniques
that have been successfully applied to image segmentation and
tracking since twenty years. This paper defines a novel purely digital deformable
model (DDM), whose internal energy is based on the minimum
length polygon (MLP). We prove that our combinatorial regularization
term has “convex” properties: any local descent on the energy leads to
a global optimum. Similarly to the continuous case where the optimum
is a straight segment, our DDM stops on a digital straight segment. The
DDM shares also the same behaviour as its continuous counterpart on
images.
