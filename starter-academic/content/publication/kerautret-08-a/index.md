abstract: '
In this paper we introduce a new curvature estimator based on global
optimisation. This method called Global Min-Curvature exploits the
geometric properties of digital contours by using local bounds on
tangent directions defined by the maximal digital straight
segments. The estimator is adapted to noisy contours by replacing
maximal segments with maximal blurred digital straight
segments. Experimentations on perfect and damaged digital contours are
performed and in both cases, comparisons with other existing methods
are presented.
