abstract: '

The Voronoi covariance measure (VCM) of a compact set K of
{{< math >}}$\mathbb{R}^d${{< /math >}} is a tensor-valued measure that encodes geometrical
information on K and which is known to be resilient to Hausdorff
noise but sensitive to outliers. In this paper, we generalize this
notion to any distance-like function &delta; and define the
&delta;-VCM. Combining the VCM with the distance to a measure and
also with the witnessed-k-distance, we get a provably good tool for
normal estimation that is resilient to Hausdorff noise and to
outliers. We present experiments showing the robustness of our
approach for normal and curvature estimation and sharp feature
detection.
