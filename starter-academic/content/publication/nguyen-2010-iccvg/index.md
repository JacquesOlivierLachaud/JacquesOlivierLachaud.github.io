abstract: '
In image processing and pattern recognition, the accuracy
of most algorithms is dependent on a good parameterization, generally
a computation scale or an estimation of the amount of noise, which may
be global or variable within the input image. Recently, a simple and
linear time algorithm for arc detection in images was proposed [1]. Its
accuracy is dependent on the correct evaluation of the amount of noise,
which was set by the user in this former version. In the present work we
integrate a promising unsupervised noise detection method [2] in this arc
recognition method, in order to process images with or without noise,
uniformly distributed or variable within the picture. We evaluate the
performance of this algorithm and we compare it with standard arc and
circle detection methods based on extensions of the Hough transform.
