abstract: '
Deformable models have shown great potential for image segmentation.
They include discrete models whose combinatorial formulation
leads to efficient and sometimes optimal minimization algorithms. In
this paper, we propose a new discrete framework to deform any partition
while preserving its topology. We show how to combine the use of multilabel
simple points, topological maps and minimum-length polygons in
order to implement an efficient digital deformable partition model. Our
experimental results illustrate the potential of our framework for segmenting
images, since it allows the mixing of region-based, contour-based
and regularization energies, while keeping the overall image structure.
