abstract: '
In many geometry processing applications, the estimation
of differential geometric quantities such as curvature or normal vector
field is an essential step. Focusing on multigrid convergent estimators,
most of them require a user specified parameter to define the scale at
which the analysis is performed (size of a convolution kernel, size of local
patches for polynomial fitting, etc). In a previous work, we have proposed
a new class of estimators on digital shape boundaries based on Integral
Invariants. In this paper, we propose new variants of these estimators
which are parameter-free and ensure multigrid convergence in 2D. As
far as we know, these are the first parameter-free multigrid convergent
curvature estimators.
