abstract: '
We show in this paper how a digital shape can be efficiently analyzed through the maximal segments defined along its digital contour. They are efficiently computable. They can be used to prove the multigrid convergence of several geometric estimators. Their asymptotic properties can be used to estimate the local amount of noise along the shape, through a multiscale analysis.
