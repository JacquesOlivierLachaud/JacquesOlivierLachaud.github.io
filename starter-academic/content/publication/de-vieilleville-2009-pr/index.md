abstract: '
Many contour-based applications rely on the estimation of the geometry
of the shape, such as pattern recognition or classification
methods. This paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation on the problem
of tangent estimators on digital curves. The methods taken into
account use different paradigms : approximation and digital
geometry. In the former paradigm, methods based on polynomial fitting,
smoothing and filtering are reviewed. In the latter case of digital
geometry, we consider two methods that mainly rely on digital straight
line recognition [Lachaud06d] and optimization [Kerautret08a]. The
comparison takes into account objective criteria such as multi-grid
convergence, average error, maximum error, isotropy and length
estimation. Experiments underline that adaptive methods based on
digital straight line recognition often propose a good trade-off
between time and precision and that if precision is to be sought,
non-adaptive methods can be easily transformed into adaptive methods
