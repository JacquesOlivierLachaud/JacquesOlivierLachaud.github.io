abstract: '
  This paper defines the basis of a new hierarchical framework for
  segmentation algorithms based on energy minimization schemes.  This
  new framework is based on two formal tools.  First, a combinatorial
  pyramid encode efficiently a hierarchy of partitions.  Secondly,
  discrete geometric estimators measure precisely some important geometric
  parameters of the regions. These measures combined with
  photometrical and topological features of the partition allows to
  design energy terms based on discrete measures. Our segmentation
  framework exploits these energies to build a pyramid of image
  partitions with a minimization scheme. Some experiments illustrating
  our framework are shown and discussed.
