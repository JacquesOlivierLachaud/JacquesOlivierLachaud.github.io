abstract: 'This work highlights the relation existing between isosurfaces of an image with a given threshold (as classically computed by a marching-cubes algorithm) and digital surfaces of this thresholded image. The first step has been to extend the classical adjacency relation defined between elements of a digital surface. It turns out that the induced surface graphs are 2D combinatorial manifolds without boundary which can easily be mapped into closed and orientable surfaces in R3. Hence, digital surfaces can be processed to compute corresponding isosurfaces; the converse is also true.'
