abstract: '
Discrete geometric estimators approach geometric quantities on
digitized shapes without any knowledge of the continuous shape. A
classical yet difficult problem is to show that an estimator
asymptotically converges toward the true geometric quantity as the
resolution increases. We study here the convergence of local
estimators based on Digital Straight Segment (DSS) recognition. It is
closely linked to the asymptotic growth of maximal DSS, for which we
show bounds both about their number and sizes. These results not only
give better insights about digitized curves but indicate that
curvature estimators based on local DSS recognition are not likely to
converge. We indeed invalidate an hypothesis which was essential in
the only known convergence theorem of a curvature estimator.  The
proof involves results from arithmetic properties of digital lines,
digital convexity, combinatorics, continued fractions and random
polytopes.
