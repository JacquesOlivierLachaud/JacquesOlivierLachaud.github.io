abstract: '
This paper proposes a set of tools to analyse the geometry of
multidimensional digital surfaces. Our approach is based on several
works of digital topology and discrete geometry: representation of
digital surfaces, bel adjacencies and digital
surface tracking, 2D tangent computation by discrete line recognition,
3D normal estimation from slice contours. The main idea is to notice
that each surface element is the crossing point of <em>n-1</em> discrete
contours lying on the surface. Each of them can be seen as a
4-connected 2D contour. We combine the directions of the tangents
extracted on each of these contours to compute the normal vector at
the considered surface element. We then define the surface area from
the normal field. The presented geometric estimators have been
implemented in a framework able to represent subsets of
<em>n</em>-dimensional spaces. As shown by our experiments, this generic
implementation is also efficient.
