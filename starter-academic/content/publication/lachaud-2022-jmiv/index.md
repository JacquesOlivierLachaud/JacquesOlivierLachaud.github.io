abstract: 'This paper proposes full convexity as an alternative
definition of digital convexity, which is valid in arbitrary
dimension. It solves many problems related to its usual definitions,
like possible non connectedness or non simple connectedness, while
encompassing its desirable features. Fully convex sets are digitally
convex, but are also connected and simply connected. They have a
morphological characterisation, which induces a simple convexity test
algorithm. Arithmetic planes are fully convex too. Full convexity
implies local full convexity, hence it enables local shape analysis,
with an unambiguous definition of convex, concave and planar
points. As a kind of relative full convexity, we propose a natural
definition of tangent subsets to a digital set. It gives rise to the
tangential cover in 2D, and to consistent extensions in arbitrary
dimension. Finally we present two applications of tangency: the first
one is a simple algorithm for building a polygonal mesh from a set of
digital points, with reversibility property, the second one is the
definition and computation of shortest paths within digital sets.'
