abstract: 'In order to define consistent models and algorithms for image analysis, many topological
representations of images have been proposed. Unfortunately the most generic ones
are often not explicitly related, and properties exhibited on one representation are unknown
for other representations. The aim of this paper is to show how two different topological
representations of images, namely the order representation (developped by Bertrand et al.)
and the complex representation using strong weak lighting functions (studied by Ayala et
al.) may be related in such a way that the results and algorithms proved on one may be
applied to the other and conversely.'
