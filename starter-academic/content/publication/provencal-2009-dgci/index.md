abstract: '
The Minimum Length Polygon (MLP) is an interesting first
order approximation of a digital contour. For instance, the convexity
of the MLP is characteristic of the digital convexity of the shape, its
perimeter is a good estimate of the perimeter of the digitized shape. We
present here two novel equivalent definitions of MLP, one arithmetic,
one combinatorial, and both definitions lead to two different linear time
algorithms to compute them.
