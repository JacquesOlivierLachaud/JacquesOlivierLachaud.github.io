abstract: 'The Elastica is a curve regularization model that integrates
the squared curvature in addition to the curve length. It has been shown
to be useful for contour smoothing and interpolation, for example in the
presence of thin elements.
In this article, we propose a graph-cut based model for optimizing the
discrete Elastica energy using a fast and efficient graph-cut model. Even
thought the Elastica energy is neither convex nor sub-modular, we show
that the final shape we achieve is often the indeed close to the globally
optimal one.
Our model easily adapts to image segmentation tasks. We show that
compared to previous work and state-of-the-art algorithm, our proposal
is simpler to implement, faster, and yields comparable or better results.'
