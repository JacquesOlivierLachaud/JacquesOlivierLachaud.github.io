abstract: '  Recent works have indicated the potential of using curvature as a
  regularizer in image segmentation, in particular for the class of
  thin and elongated objects. These are ubiquitous in biomedical
  imaging (e.g. vascular networks), in which length regularization can
  sometime perform badly, as well as in texture
  identification. However, curvature is a second-order differential measure,
  and so its estimators are sensitive to noise. The straightforward
  extensions to Total Variation are not convex, making them a challenge
  to optimize.  State-of-art techniques make use of a coarse
  approximation of curvature that limits practical applications.

  We argue that curvature must instead be computed using a multigrid
  convergent estimator, and we propose in this paper a new digital
  curvature flow which mimics continuous curvature flow. We
  illustrate its potential as a post-processing step to a variational
  segmentation framework.
