abstract: '
  Estimating the geometry of a digital shape or contour is an
  important task in many image analysis applications.  This paper
  proposes an in-depth experimental comparison between various
  continuous tangent estimators and a representative digital tangent
  estimator. The continuous estimators belong to two standard
  approximation methods: least square fitting and gaussian
  smoothing. The digital estimator is based on the extraction of
  maximal digital straight segments [Lachaud05a,Lachaud06d]. The
  comprehensive comparison takes into account objective criteria such
  as isotropy and multigrid convergence.  Experiments underline that
  the proposed digital estimator addresses many of the proposed
  objective criteria and that it is in general as good - if not better
  - than continuous methods.
