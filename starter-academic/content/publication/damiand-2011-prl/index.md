abstract: '
 The main contribution of this paper is the definition
  of multi-label simple points ensuring that the partition topology
  remains invariant during a deformation process. The definition is
  based on intervoxel properties, and uses the notion of collapse on
  cubical complexes. This work is an extension of a restricted
  definition that prohibits the move of intersections of boundary
  surfaces. A deformation process is carried out with a greedy energy
  minimization algorithm. A discrete area estimator is used to
  approach at best standard regularizers classically used in
  continuous energy minimizing methods. The effectiveness of our
  approach is illustrated by the deformation of topologically correct
  initial partitions of a 3D medical image to minimize its energy.
