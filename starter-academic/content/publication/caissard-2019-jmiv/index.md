abstract: 'This article presents a novel discretization of the
Laplaceâ€“Beltrami operator on digital surfaces.We adapt an existing
convolution technique proposed by Belkin et al. for triangular
meshes to topological border of subsets of {{< math
>}}$\mathbb{Z}^n${{< /math >}}. The core of the method relies on
first-order estimation of measures associated with our discrete
elements (such as length, area etc.). We show strong consistency
(i.e. pointwise convergence) of the operator and compare it against
various other discretizations.'
