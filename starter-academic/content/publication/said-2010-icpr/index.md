abstract: '
A theory for the multiscale analysis of digital shapes would be very interesting for the pattern recognition community, giving a digital equivalent of the continuous scale-space theory. We focus here on providing analytical formulae of the multiresolution of Digital Straight Segments (DSS), which is a fundamental tool for describing digital shape contours.
