abstract: '
Several curvature estimators along digital contours were proposed in recent works [1,2,3]. These estimators are adapted to non perfect digitization process and can process noisy contours. In this paper, we compare and analyse the performances of these estimators on several types of contours and we measure execution time on both perfect and noisy shapes. In a second part, we evaluate these estimators in the context of corner detection. Finally to evaluate the performance of a non curvature based approach, we compare the results with a morphological corner detector [4].
