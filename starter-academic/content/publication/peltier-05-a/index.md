abstract: '
Topological invariants are extremely useful in many applications
related to digital imaging and geometric modelling, and homology is a
classical one. We present an algorithm that computes the whole
homology of an object of arbitrary dimension: Betti numbers, torsion
coefficients and generators.  Results on classical shapes in algebraic
topology are presented and discussed.
