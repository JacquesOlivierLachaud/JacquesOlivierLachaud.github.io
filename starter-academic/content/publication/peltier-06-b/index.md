abstract: '
Topological invariants are extremely useful in many applications
related to digital imaging and geometric modeling, and homology is a
classical one, which has not yet been fully explored in image
applications. We present an algorithm that computes the whole homology
of an object of arbitrary dimension: Betti numbers, torsion
coefficients and generators. The effective implementation of this algorithm
has been realized in order to perform experimentations. Results on
classical shapes in algebraic topology and on discrete objects are
presented and discussed.
