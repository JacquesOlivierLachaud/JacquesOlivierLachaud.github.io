abstract: '
We propose a novel approach to reconstruct
shapes from digital data. Contrarily to most methods, reconstructed
shapes are smooth with a well-defined curvature
field and have the same digitization as the input data:
the range of application we have in mind is especially postprocessing
to image segmentation where labelled regions
are digital objects. For this purpose, we introduce three new
algorithms to regularize digital contours based on the minimization
of Willmore energy: our first algorithm is based on
tools coming from discrete geometry, the second is related
to convex geometry while the third approach is a constrained
phase field minimization. The three algorithms are described
in details and the convergence of the phase field approach
is investigated. We present a comparative evaluation of all
three methods, in terms of the accuracy of curvature estimators
and computation time.
