abstract: Digital objects and digital surfaces are isothetic structures per se. Such
  surfaces are thus not adapted to direct visualization with isothetic quads, or to
  many geometry processing methods. We propose a new regularization technique to construct
  a piecewise smooth quadrangulated surface from a digital surface. More formally
  we propose a variational formulation which efficiently regularizes digital surface
  vertices while complying with a prescribed, eventually anisotropic, input normal
  vector field estimated on the digital structure. Beside visualization purposes,
  such regularized surface can then be used in any geometry processing tasks which
  operates on triangular or quadrangular meshes (e.g. compression, texturing, anisotropic
  smoothing, feature extraction).
