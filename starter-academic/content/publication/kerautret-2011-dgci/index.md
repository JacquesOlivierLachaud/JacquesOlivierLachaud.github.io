abstract: '
We address the problem of constructing an approximate continuous
representation of a digital contour with guarantees on the Hausdorff
error between the digital shape and its reconstruction. Instead of
polygonalizing the contour, we propose to reconstruct the shape with
circular arcs. To do so, we exploit the recent curvature estimators. From
their curvature field, we introduce a new simple and efficient algorithm
to approximate a digital shape with as few arcs as possible at a given
scale, specified by a maximal admissible Hausdorff distance. We show
the potential of our reconstruction method with numerous experiments
and we also compare our results with some recent promising approaches.
Last, all these algorithms are available online for comparisons on arbitrary
shapes.
