abstract: Energy-minimizing techniques are an interesting approach to the segmentation
  problem. They extract image components by deforming a geometric model according
  to energy constraints. This paper proÂ­poses an extension to these works, which can
  segment arbitrarily complex image components in any dimension. The geometric model
  is a digital surface with which an energy is associated. The model grows inside
  the component to segment by following minimal energy paths. The segmentation result
  is obtained em a posteriori by examining the energies of the successive model shapes.
  We validate our approach on several 2D images.
