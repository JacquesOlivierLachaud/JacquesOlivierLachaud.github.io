 abstract = {Energy-minimizing techniques are an interesting approach to the
segmentation problem. They extract image components by deforming a
geometric model according to energy constraints. This paper proÂ­poses
an extension to these works, which can segment arbitrarily complex
image components in any dimension. The geometric model is a digital
surface with which an energy is associated. The model grows inside the
component to segment by following minimal energy paths. The
segmentation result is obtained \em a posteriori by examining the
energies of the successive model shapes. We validate our approach on
several 2D images.},
