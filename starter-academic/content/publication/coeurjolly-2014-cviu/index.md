abstract: '
In many geometry processing applications, the estimation of differential geometric quantities such as curvature or normal vector field is an essential step. In this paper, we investigate a new class of estimators on digital shape boundaries based on Integral Invariants. More precisely, we provide both proofs of multigrid convergence of principal curvature estimators and a complete experimental evaluation of their performances.
