abstract: '
  Discrete geometric estimators aim at estimating geometric
  characteristics of a shape with only its digitization as input data.
  Such an estimator is multigrid convergent when its estimates tend
  toward the geometric characteristics of the shape as the
  digitization step h tends toward 0.  This paper studies
  the
  multigrid convergence of tangent estimators based on maximal digital
  straight segment recognition. We show that such estimators are
  multigrid convergent for some family of convex shapes and that their
  speed of convergence is on average
  O(h<sup>2/3</sup>). Experiments confirm this result and
  suggest that the bound is tight.
