abstract: '
A robust discrete curvature estimator was recently proposed by Kerautret et al. [1]. In this paper, we exploit the precision and stability of this estimator in order to define a contour extraction method for analysing geometric features. We propose to use a reference curvature function for extracting the frontier of a shape in a gray level image. The frontier extraction is done by using both geometric information represented by the reference curvature and gradient information contained in the source image. The application of this work is done in a medical application.
