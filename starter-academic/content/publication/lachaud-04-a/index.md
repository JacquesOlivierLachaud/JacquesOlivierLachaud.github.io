abstract: '
    In this paper we propose a parametric deformable model
    that automatically adapts its topology and that recovers
    accurately image components with a complexity independent from the
    resolution of input image. The main idea is to equip the image
    space with a metric that expands interesting features in the image
    depending on their geometry.
