abstract: '
This paper presents a straightforward top-down segmentation method based on a contour approach on histological images. Our
approach relies on a digital deformable model whose internal energy is
based on the minimum length polygon and that uses a greedy algorithm
to minimise its energy. Experiments on real histological images of breast
cancer yields results as good as that of classical active contours.
