abstract: '
The sequence of maximal segments (i.e. the tangential cover)
along a digital boundary is an essential tool for analyzing the geometry
of two-dimensional digital shapes. The purpose of this paper is to de-
fine similar primitives for three-dimensional digital shapes, i.e. maximal
planes defined over their boundary. We provide for them an unambiguous
geometrical definition avoiding a simple greedy characterization as
previous approaches. We further develop a multiscale theory of maximal
planes. We show that these primitives are representative of the geometry
of the digital object at different scales, even in the presence of noise.
