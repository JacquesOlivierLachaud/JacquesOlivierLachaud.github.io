abstract: '
The automatic detection of noisy or damaged parts along digital
contours is a difficult problem since it is hard to distinguish
between information and perturbation without further a priori
hypotheses. However, solving this issue has a great impact on numerous
applications, including image segmentation, geometric estimators,
contour reconstruction, shape matching, or image edition. We propose
an original strategy to detect the relevant scales at which
each point of the digital contours should be considered. It relies on
theoretical results of asymptotic discrete geometry. A direct
consequence is the automatic detection of the noisy or damaged parts
of the contour, together with its quantitative evaluation (or noise
level). Apart from a given maximal observation scale, the proposed
approach does not require any parameter tuning and is easy to
implement. We demonstrate its effectiveness on several datasets. We
present different direct applications of this local measure to contour
smoothing and geometric estimators whose algorithms initially required
a noise/scale parameter to tune: They show the pertinence of the
proposed measure for digital shape analysis and reconstruction.
