abstract: 'This paper presents new results about digital straight segments, their
recognition and related properties. They come from the study of the
arithmetically based recognition algorithm proposed by
I. Debled-Rennesson and J.-P. Reveill√®s in 1995. We indeed exhibit
the relations describing the possible changes in the parameters of the
digital straight segment under investigation.  This description is
achieved by considering new parameters on digital segments: instead of
their arithmetic description, we examine the parameters related to
their combinatoric description. As a result we have a better
understanding of their evolution during recognition and analytical
formulas to compute them. We also show how this evolution can be
projected onto the Stern-Brocot tree. These new relations have
interesting consequences on the geometry of digital curves. We show
how they can for instance be used to bound the slope difference
between consecutive maximal segments.
