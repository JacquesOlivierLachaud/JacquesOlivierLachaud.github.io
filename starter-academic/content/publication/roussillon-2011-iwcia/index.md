abstract: '
We propose in this paper a new curvature estimator based
on the set of maximal digital circular arcs. For strictly convex shapes
with continuous curvature fields digitized on a grid of step h, we show
that this estimator is mutligrid convergent if the discrete length of the
maximal digital circular arcs grows in &Omega;(h^(-1/2)). We indeed observed this
order of magnitude. Moreover, experiments showed that our estimator
is at least as fast to compute as existing estimators and more accurate
even at low resolution.
