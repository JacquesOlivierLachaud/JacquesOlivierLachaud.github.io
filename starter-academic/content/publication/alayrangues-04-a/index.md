abstract: '
Many combinatorial structures have been designed to represent the
topology of space subdivisions and images.  We focus here on two
particular models, namely the n-G-maps used in geometric modeling
and computational geometry and the n-surfaces used in discrete
imagery. We show that a subclass of n-G-maps is equivalent to
n-surfaces. We exhibit a local property characterising this
subclass, which is easy to check algorithmatically. Finally, the
proofs being constructive, we show how to switch from one
representation to another effectively.
