abstract: '
This paper presents a comparative evaluation of tangent estimators
based on digital line recognition on digital curves. The comparison is
carried out with a comprehensive set of criteria: accuracy on smooth
or polygonal shapes, behaviour on convex/concave parts, computation
time, isotropy, aymptotic convergence. We further propose a new
estimator mixing the qualities of existing ones and outperforming them
on most mentioned points.
