abstract: '
We present new results concerning the Delaunay triangulation
of the set of points of pieces of digital straight lines. More precisely,
we show how the triangulation topology follows the arithmetic decomposition
of the line slope as well as its combinatorial decomposition (splitting
formula). A byproduct is a linear time algorithm for computing the
Delaunay triangulation and the Voronoi diagram of such sets.
