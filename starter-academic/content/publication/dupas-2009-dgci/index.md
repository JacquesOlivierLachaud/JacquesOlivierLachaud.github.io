abstract: '
The main contribution of this paper is the definition of multilabel
simple points that ensures that the partition topology remains invariant
during a deformable partition process. The definition is based
on simple intervoxel properties and is easy to implement. A deformation
process is carried out with a greedy energy minimization algorithm. A
discrete area estimator is used to approach at best standard regularizers
classically used in continuous energy minimizing methods. The effectiveness
of our approach is shown on several 3D image segmentations.
