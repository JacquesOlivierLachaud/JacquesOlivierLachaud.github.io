abstract: '
This paper proposes a concise coding of the cells of <em>n</em>-dimensional
finite regular grids. It induces a simple, generic and efficient
framework for implementing classical digital topology data structures
and algorithms. Discrete subsets of multidimensional images (e.g.
regions, digital surfaces, cubical cell complexes) have then a common
and compact representation. Moreover, algorithms have a
straightforward and efficient implementation, which is independent
from the dimension or sizes of digital images. We illustrate that
point with generic hypersurface boundary extraction algorithms by
scanning or tracking. This framework has been implemented and basic
operations as well as the presented applications have been benchmarked.
