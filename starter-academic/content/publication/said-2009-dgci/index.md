abstract: '
This paper presents a first step in analyzing how digital
shapes behave with respect to multiresolution. We first present an analysis
of the covering of a standard digital straight line by a multi-resolution
grid. We then study the multi-resolution of Digital Straight Segments
(DSS): we provide a sublinear algorithm computing the exact characteristics
of a DSS whenever it is a subset of a known standard line. We
finally deduce an algorithm for computing a multiscale representation of
a digital shape, based only on a DSS decomposition of its boundary.
