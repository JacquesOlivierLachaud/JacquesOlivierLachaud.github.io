abstract: '
In this paper, we present a new three-dimensional (3D) tangent
estimator by extending the well-known two-dimensional (2D)
&lambda;-maximal segment tangent (&lambda;-MST) estimator, which has
very good theoretical and practical behaviors. We show that our
proposed estimator keeps the same time complexity, accuracy and
experimental asymptotic behaviors as the original 2D one.
