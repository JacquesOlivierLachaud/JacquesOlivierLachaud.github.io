abstract: Many problems in image analysis, digital processing and shape optimization
  can be expressed as variational problems involving the discretization of the Laplace-Beltrami
  operator. Such discretizations have been widely studied for meshes or polyhedral
  surfaces. On digital surfaces, direct applications of classical operators are usually
  not satisfactory (lack of multigrid convergence, lack of precision...). In this
  paper, we first evaluate previous alternatives and propose a new digital Laplace-Beltrami
  operator showing interesting properties. This new operator adapts Belkin et al.
  [2] to digital surfaces embedded in 3D. The core of the method relies on an accurate
  estimation of measures associated to digital surface elements. We experimentally
  evaluate the interest of this operator for digital geometry processing tasks.
