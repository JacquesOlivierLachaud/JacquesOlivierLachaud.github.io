The CoMeDiC project aims at filling the gap between discrete calculus
and standard calculus in the case of the digital space Zn. The global
idea is to reliably estimate a metric on digital curves and surfaces
such that solving PDEs on these domains with discrete calculus
converges toward standard calculus solutions. This approach, a kind of
digital calculus, is now conceivable due to recent progresses in
digital geometry about the multigrid convergence of length, area,
normal and even curvature estimators. Such estimators should induce
convergent metrics for many different subsets of digital
spaces. Digital calculus would then address an important bottleneck
faced by most standard numerical discretization schemes: how to handle
variational problems involving objects or functions of dimension k < n
(e.g. surfaces in R3 or Z3, curves on surfaces, etc). This project
focuses on three domains of application for digital calculus — image
analysis, digital geometry processing and shape optimization — both to
guide and nourish theoretical developments, as well as to serve as
testbed for digital calculus.

## Consortium

This project gathers members of four laboratories: LAMA (Leader, Chambéry), LIRIS (Lyon), LJK (Grenoble), LIGM (Marne-la-vallée).
